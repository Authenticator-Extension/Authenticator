# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest versions published on the Chrome, Firefox, and Edge extension stores.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report potential vulnerabilities privately via [this form](https://github.com/Authenticator-Extension/Authenticator/security/advisories/new).
Where appropriate, include a proof-of-concept and reproduction steps.
We strive to provide an initial response within five days, but as this is a volunteer-run project, we make no guarantees.
